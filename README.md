# Landing Page Project

## About the project

This is the second project of the **Front-End Developer Nanodegree program by Udacity**.
The starter code (CSS & HTML) has been provided by Udacity, although I have slightly changed the styling.

## Project requirements

The aim of this project is to test our DOM manipulation skills. I had to:

- Pogrammatically builds navigation,
- Scroll to anchors from navigation,
- Highlight section in viewport upon scrolling.

## Additional notes

The totality of the project uses CSS, HTML and Vanilla JavaScript exclusively.
